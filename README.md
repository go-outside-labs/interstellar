# Researching the Interstellar Dust 

<br>

The study of intermediate-age open clusters can be used to the learn about the stellar
evolution of intermediate-mass stars and the dynamical evolution of clusters together with their interstellar extinction. 

The interstellar extinction is a sum of absorption and scattering of the light within the interstellar medium, being inversely proportional to the light wavelength. 

Consequently, a general increase in absorption toward shorter wavelengths is observed, resulting to the effect of reddening.

In this repository I made available the source code for data reduction and analysis in IDL, and my report and results as well.

[Here is the final report in this work](https://github.com/go-outside-labs/Studying_the_Interstellar_Dust/blob/master/Interstellar_Extinction.pdf).
